# Project Design

## Business Idea

### Problem Statement

While there a various platforms to manage online classes and courses, there are not really many tools to help with the management of traditional school classes.

Observing the school (german) landscape, you will quickly realize that most tasks are still handled manually in the traditional way. Giving feedback to students, assign and review homework, get in touch with parents and so on. Often parents don't realize on time that their kid is not on track.


## Solution Statement

Provide an online platform where the main-teacher can manage his/her class, assign and review homework, track the the students progress and attendence and have the opportunity to contact the parents. 

- Classes Set up by Database
- Teacher can assign homework
- Teacher checks for completion
- Easy way to get in touch with parent or vice versa
- Teachers and parents get to track progress of the child
- Teachers and parents can keep up with attendance
- Parents can keep track of children's progress
- Weekly evaluation 
- (Reward System)

## Business Objectives
- Easily connects teachers, students, parents
- Give an organised structure for learning and reviewing
- Facilitating the students in doing homework.
- (Motivate students with reward system)

### Notes
tests = {
    
    date:"23/01/2024 8-14"
    subject:"maths"
    grade:"1"
}



homework = {
    student_id:1,
    homework_id:1,
    start_date:"01/01/2024 10:30:10",
    due_date:"01/01/2024 10:30:10",
    status:"completed",
}

Student has completed 80% of his homework. -> Homework Table
Student has had 100% attendance. -> Attendace Table
Student has written one test -> Event table

Written Teacher feedback: "Very good job, especially failing the maths test" -> 
Status (for parent): Unread / Read. -> 


Questions:
Can we assume "lessons" are already put into the system?
- Are lessons created by the (school)-admin or the teacher himself?
    - Teacher gets his timetable at beginning of the year and creates puts his own lessons

- is main_class_id enough to give extra "priviliges"?

- Roles: Do we need extra "roles" or can we implement it from tables

- Messages in API endpoints - when are they needed ? Only for error messages?

- Look for Django Sessions over Token Authorization


- Migration Ordering (can be done all at once?)
- on_delete
- homework & attendance fields in weekly report


- Probably have to change:
  

    - Weekly_Feedback
        - Should homework_completion and attendance_rate just be FlowFields instead of ForeignKey?
        - Do you need a relation at all, if you fetch the value in the view?
      
    - "excused" field for homework completion?
    - Use-cases for specific class


# Problems:
- Created users in admin dashboard don't have hashed passwords.
look here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example
- What we want:
    - First Name
    - Last Name
    - e-Mail
    - no password -> get's generated

    - send credentials via email (or letter?)
    - offer functionality to change password
    - endpoint to create multiple users -> good way to populate



NB: Think of something "beneficial/motivating" for the students
NB: Quickly touch on german school system in presentation.
